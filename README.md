# Automated-Question-Generation
A program to automatically generate natural language questions from scientific datasets.

Our Question Generation from Datasets (QGD) pipeline is split into 5 phases that handle data extraction and cleaning, entity recognition, semantic categorization, similarity index calculation for correlating identified meta-categories with domain specific keywords and a question generation module that formulates natural language questions by semantically transforming a question string generated by combining related columns in the dataset with associated operators and dataset values. We have used the Indiana Hub data repository, census and labor and stats bureau as the data sources for our project. The figure below provides an outline of the workflow of our pipeline.
